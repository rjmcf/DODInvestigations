Order of implementation:
     1. Enemy with empty update (position is in top left)
     2. EnemyWithHealth draws a health bar
     3. Health Animation, initial to final, interpolated, all animations loop
     4. Add Easing Functions to animations
     5. Translation, Deform, Colour Animations
     6. Refactor to EnemyController and Scene
     7. Refactor Animations to take difference
     8. Refactor Translation animations to take a vector of targets
     9. Refactor to AnimationController
    10. Add Singleton EventManager for events framework
    11. Make Animations fire events
    12. Implement ChainAnimations
    13. Move enemy position to centre
    14. Add stats printing to all animations and enemies (and controllers)
    15. Enable killing of enemies, which stops their animations and changes how they draw
    16. Give enemies eyes, implement update function
    17. Animate background colour
    18. Implement enemy attachments - unanimated Shield
    19. Refactor to DrawCall framework, multithread rendering
    20. Implement enemy batches
    21. Add spears
    22. Add spear animation (initiated by calling method on Spear object)
    23. Implement Animation Library
        * AnimationID identifies types of animations (e.g. Attack, Defend)
        * AnimatedObjectType identifies types of objects that can be animated (e.g. Shields, Spears)
        * AnimationLibraryEntry implements animations associated with desired AnimationIds for each AnimatedObjectType
        * AnimationLibrary lets you start an animation with a particular id on a particular object
        * AnimationController lets you start an animation with a particular id on all animated objects 
    24. Add Shield animations
    25. Add animated Knives



Difficulties:
(See commit with https://github.com/rjmcf/DODInvestigations/commit/<commit>)
    * Adding ChainAnimations meant changing base classes: 3b4abf9e813a69f18f89aa251805e7e30f76ad6c
    * Adding stats meant changing every class in hierarchy: a33ddd505d908c57710b5514c17e03fa83e4a233
    * Adding killing of enemies meant changing every class in both hierarchies: 43956a33d326ac1c68f9de1433cb6c3c1f1f8705 and f04c4f9133ef9e421bd67db0ecd49fb0edbc6bb3
    * Need for dynamic_cast to move between hierarchies, seems to be required for LSP: 2965d0eabb10751a15b9f9b1a16e778403779894

Easy things:
    * Adding eyes to base enemies almost automatically added them to EnemiesWithHealth
