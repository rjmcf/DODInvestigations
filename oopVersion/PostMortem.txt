Order of implementation:
    1. Enemy with empty update (position is in top left)
    2. EnemyWithHealth draws a health bar
    3. Health Animation, initial to final, interpolated, all animations loop
    4. Add Easing Functions to animations
    5. Translation, Deform, Colour Animations
    6. Refactor to EnemyController and Scene
    7. Refactor Animations to take difference
    8. Refactor Translation animations to take a vector of targets
    9. Refactor to AnimationController
   10. Add Singleton EventManager for events framework
   11. Make Animations fire events
   12. Implement ChainAnimations
   13. Move enemy position to centre
   14. Add stats printing to all animations and enemies (and controllers)
   15. Enable killing of enemies, which stops their animations and changes how they draw
   16. Give enemies eyes, implement update function
   17. Hide majority of enemies
   18. Animate background colour


Difficulties:
(See commit with https://github.com/rjmcf/DODInvestigations/commit/<commit>)
    * Adding ChainAnimations meant changing base classes: 3b4abf9e813a69f18f89aa251805e7e30f76ad6c
    * Adding stats meant changing every class in hierarchy: a33ddd505d908c57710b5514c17e03fa83e4a233
    * Adding killing of enemies meant changing every class in both hierarchies: 43956a33d326ac1c68f9de1433cb6c3c1f1f8705 and f04c4f9133ef9e421bd67db0ecd49fb0edbc6bb3

Easy things:
    * Adding eyes to base enemies almost automatically added them to EnemiesWithHealth
